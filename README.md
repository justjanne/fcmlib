# Rust FCM Library

This project contains a fully fledged implementation of Brother's FCM format,
allowing you to read, write, edit and create FCM files natively.

The library is designed to create files which are bit-for-bit identical to ones
that Canvas Workspace (web or app) would have created. To ensure compatibility,
over 1000 sample files are used as test cases.

The FCM parser was written using Nom to ensure it's safe and secure.
